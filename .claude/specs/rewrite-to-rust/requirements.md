# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for rewriting the entire project from its current technology stack to the Rust programming language. The primary goals of this rewrite are to improve performance, enhance memory safety, increase concurrency, and modernize the codebase for better long-term maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Full Functional Parity

**User Story:** As a user, I want the rewritten application to have all the same features and functionality as the original application, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  IF a feature exists in the original application, THEN the Rust application SHALL implement the same feature.
2.  WHEN a user performs an action that succeeded in the original application, THEN the Rust application SHALL produce the same successful outcome.
3.  WHEN a user provides an input that was valid in the original application, THEN the Rust application SHALL accept it as valid.
4.  WHEN a user provides an input that was invalid in the original application, THEN the Rust application SHALL reject it with a comparable error message.

### Requirement 2: Build and Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the rewritten project to have a streamlined build and deployment process, so that I can easily create and distribute releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  WHEN the `pnpm build` command is run, THEN the system SHALL compile the Rust code and produce an optimized, production-ready executable.
2.  IF the original project had a deployment script, THEN the system SHALL have an equivalent script for deploying the Rust application.
3.  WHEN a new release is created, THEN the system SHALL automate the process of versioning, tagging, and creating release artifacts.

### Requirement 3: Testing and Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the rewritten project to have a comprehensive test suite, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  IF a unit test existed in the original project, THEN the Rust project SHALL have an equivalent passing unit test.
2.  IF an integration test existed in the original project, THEN the Rust project SHALL have an equivalent passing integration test.
3.  WHEN code is committed, THEN a continuous integration (CI) pipeline SHALL automatically run all tests.
4.  WHEN the test suite is run, THEN it SHALL achieve a minimum of 90% code coverage.

### Requirement 4: Dependency Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the rewritten project to use modern and well-maintained Rust crates, so that the project is secure and easy to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  IF the original project used an external library, THEN the Rust project SHALL use a suitable and actively maintained crate from the Rust ecosystem to replace it.
2.  WHEN the project dependencies are audited, THEN there SHALL be no known critical security vulnerabilities.
3.  All dependencies SHALL be managed using `Cargo.toml` as per standard Rust conventions.

### Requirement 5: Performance

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want the rewritten application to be at least as performant as the original, so that the migration provides a tangible benefit.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1.  WHEN key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time or resource usage are measured, THEN the Rust application's performance SHALL be equal to or better than the original application under similar load conditions.
2.  IF specific performance benchmarks existed for the original application, THEN the Rust application SHALL meet or exceed those benchmarks.
